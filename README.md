# Matrix-Control-Panel
A Panel for controlling homeservers on the matrix communication network.
This project will attempt to simplify [synapse server](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) administration.

## Overview
This project will aim to provide two methods of server administraton. There will be a Panel-as-a-Service (PaaS) and a self hosted panel. The PaaS will aim to provide basic administration of a homeserver using API access as well as various benefits of a cloud solution. The Self hosted version, on the other hand, will aim to provide more powerful administration tools but will require direct DB access. 

The panel will use API based administration unless an optional worker is installed with synapse.
