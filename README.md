# Matrix-Control-Panel
A Panel for controlling homeservers on the matrix communication network.
This project will attempt to simplify [synapse server](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) administration.

## Overview
This project will aim to provide two methods of server administraton. There will be a Panel-as-a-Service (PaaS) and a self hosted panel. The PaaS will aim to provide basic administration of a homeserver using API access as well as various benefits of a cloud solution. The Self hosted version, on the other hand, will aim to provide more powerful administration tools but will require direct DB access. 
### PaaS
* HA service
* Uptime/Timing tracking and notification
* Managed and secure cpanel like UI
### Self Hosted
* On site - you control your own data
* Ability to manage the database directly
